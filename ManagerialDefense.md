# Phase 3 — Managerial Defense (Governance & Finance)

## Project
AI Procurement Contract Intelligence Agent for Air Astana

---

## 1. Financial Reasoning (ROI Estimate)

### Strategic Alignment: "Efficiency" Pillar
This initiative directly supports the Group's **"Efficiency"** pillar (Annual Report, p. 4), specifically the goal of "Proactive cost management" to maintain robust CASK (Cost of Available Seat Kilometer) performance.

### Business Assumption
Air Astana’s procurement officers spend significant time manually reviewing supplier contracts, maintenance agreements, and compliance documentation.

### Time Savings Hypothesis
If the AI Agent saves **10 hours per week** for one Procurement Officer:
- 10 hours/week → 40 hours/month

### Annual Financial Impact
*   **Time Value**: ~21 million KZT/year (across 10 specialists).
*   **Cost Avoidance**: Reducing "supply chain disruptions" (e.g., engine parts logistics) which are cited as a key operational risk.

## 2. Cost Consideration & Infrastructure

Additional costs include:
- Cloud infrastructure hosting
- Integration with existing **internal audit software (TeamMate+)** workflow.

The project aligns with the **CDIO's digitalization strategy** (p. 196) to move beyond basic automation to intelligent decision support.

## 3. Governance & Ethics Check (Kazakhstan Context)

### Strategic Alignment: "Corporate Governance"
This project adheres to the **Corporate Risk Management System (CRMS)** (p. 74) by standardizing risk detection in contracts.

### Key Risks
1.  **Data Residency**: Must comply with Kazakhstan data sovereignty laws; no sensitive LSE/KASE compliance data to leave local servers.
2.  **Hallucination Risk**: Aviation procurement requires 100% accuracy (e.g., EASA safety certifications). AI will be a *second-opinion screener*, not a final approver.
3.  **Auditability**: All AI suggestions must be logged to satisfy the **Audit Committee** and Internal Audit Service (IAS).

---

## 4. Risk Mitigation Requirements

To proceed safely and match the **"Excellence"** pillar:
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Mandatory manual sign-off for any contract >$50k USD.
- **Scope 3 Readiness**: The AI can be trained to flag vendors missing **Sustainability/Decarbonization** certifications, accelerating the Group's "Scope 3 emissions calculation" planned for 2025.

---

## 5. Executive Recommendation: GO / NO-GO

### Decision: **GO (Conditional Approval)**

Proceed with development only if:
1.  **Governance**: Integrated into the existing CRMS framework.
2.  **Safety**: "Safety first" culture is respected; AI does not touch safety-critical engineering authorizations without human oversight.

**Conclusion**: This transforms Procurement from a manual bottleneck into a strategic enabler, directly supporting Air Astana's vision to be "one of the finest airline groups in the world" through digital excellence.
