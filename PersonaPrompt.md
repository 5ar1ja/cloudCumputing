## 5 Whys Interview

### Q1: Why is procurement slow in Air Astana?
**Answer (based on Annual Report context):**  
Procurement is slow because every supplier contract undergoes rigorous scrutiny to comply with our **Corporate Risk Management System (CRMS)** and post-IPO transparency requirements. We must vet heavily for safety (EASA/IOSA standards) and financial risks (counterparty credit checks).

---

### Q2: Why does every contract require manual review?
**Answer:**  
Because our supply chain is currently our "most exposed asset to climate-related physical risks" and subject to volatile global disruptions (like the Pratt & Whitney engine issues). We manually verify that vendors meet our strict **Code of Ethics** and **Sustainability/Decarbonization** targets (Scope 3 preparation).

---

### Q3: Why is there no automation for first-level screening?
**Answer:**  
Our IT resources have been focused on "digitalisation" of *customer-facing* channels (FlyArystan app, Nomad Club) rather than back-office efficiency. Our internal audit still relies on tools like "TeamMate+" for compliance rather than proactive AI procurement intelligence.

---

### Q4: Why hasn’t such a system been implemented yet?
**Answer:**  
We still operate on a **Project-based budgeting model** ("0-1 year - aligned with the budget"). Innovation funds are allocated to "strategic" passenger growth projects, leaving support functions like procurement to rely on "outsourced" IT maintenance rather than transformed product capabilities.

---

### Q5: Why is the organization hesitant to introduce AI into contract decisions?
**Answer:**  
The Board and Audit Committee prioritize "internal control" and "financial resilience" over speed. There is a cultural preference for "proven" manual governance to avoid any "material misstatement" or regulatory breach that could impact our new dual-listing status on the LSE and KASE.

---

## Root Cause Insight
The core problem is not just speed — it is a lack of trusted decision-support infrastructure and a risk-averse governance model, which keeps procurement dependent on manual approvals.
