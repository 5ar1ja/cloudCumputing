# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Board of Directors, Air Astana  
**FROM:** External Product Transformation Auditor  
**DATE:** 2026-02-04  
**SUBJECT:** Diagnostic of Product Operating Model Maturity  

## Executive Summary
Air Astana has successfully modernized its technology leadership (appointing a CDIO) and internalized some software development ("best IT employer"). However, the 2024 Operating Model remains firmly rooted in **IT-style project delivery** rather than a **Product Operating Model**. The focus is on "digitalisation" (digitizing existing processes) rather than empowering teams to solve customer problems. The risk is high investment in technology that delivers "output" (features) without achieving the desired "outcome" (business value).

## Feature Factory Risks (Cagan Test Analysis)

1.  **Mercenaries vs. Missionaries**: There is significant reliance on "outsourcing IT systems" and "third-party service providers". In-house teams appear to be organized around "projects and targets" (assigned work) rather than assigned customer problems to solve. This structure creates "Mercenaries"—teams paid to build what they are told—rather than "Missionaries" who care about the outcome.
2.  **Project vs. Product Funding**: The report links strategy intimately with annual budgeting ("0-1 year - aligned with the budget"). This confirms a **Project Funding** model where scope is locked early to secure budget. There is no evidence of a "Product Funding" model (funding enduring teams to pursue quarterly outcomes), which prevents agility when market assumptions change.
3.  **Output vs. Outcome Metrics**: Success is measured by "projects completed" and lagging indicators like "CSAT" (Customer Satisfaction) or "efficiency". There is **Insufficient Evidence** of teams being measured by direct product outcomes (e.g., "increase search-to-book conversion by 5%" or "reduce check-in time by 20s"). Without these, teams focus on shipping features, not creating value.

## Strategic Disconnects
*   **IT as a Cost Center**: While "Digital" is strategic, the report refers to IT systems being "outsourced" and focused on "efficiency" and "internal control". This signals that Technology is still viewed largely as a **cost center/enabler** rather than the core business differentiator.
*   **Digital vs. Product**: The terminology "Digital channels" implies that "Digital" is just a distribution channel for the airline, rather than the product itself. In a modern airline, the digital experience *is* the product for the passenger's journey.

## Prescription (Immediate Actions)

*   **Pilot "Empowered Product Teams"**: Select 2 key strategic areas (e.g., Mobile App, Loyalty). Replace the "Project Manager" with a strong **Product Manager** and give the team a specific **Business Problem** (e.g., "Reduce call center volume by 10%") rather than a feature roadmap.
*   **Shift Funding Logic for Digital**: Move the in-house digital teams off "Project Funding" and onto "Team Funding". Fund the *team* for the year, but review their *outcomes* quarterly. This stops the "negotiating for scope" game and starts the "negotiating for value" game.
*   **Insourcing Strategy**: Aggressively transition core digital differentiators (Booking engine, Passenger App, Loyalty) away from "third-party providers" to 100% in-house ownership. You cannot outsource your competitive advantage.
